  For Non-Hispanic White and Non-Hispanic Asian, the greatest number of
people who died from COVID-19 were in the 85+ year age group. In other
minority groups, including Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Black, and
Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, younger age groups had
the highest number of COVID-19 deaths, 50-64 years, 65-74 years, and
50-64 years, respectively. These trends could reflect the health
disparities that were exacerbated during the pandemic.

  For most of the age groups, there have been more COVID-19 deaths in
males compared to females. In the oldest age group (85+ years), more
women have died from COVID-19 than men. Studies have suggested that
there is an association between COVID-19 outcomes and morbidity by sex.
These gender differences could potentially be related to the incidence
of COVID-19 co-morbidities in men and women. Overall, COVID-19 mortality
increases with age and there are sex differences in COVID-19 deaths.
