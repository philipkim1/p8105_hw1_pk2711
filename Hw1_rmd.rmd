# Problem 1

Create a data frame comprised of:

  1. a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  2. a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  3. a character vector of length 10
  4. a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r}
set.seed(1)

problem1_df = 
  tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10),
  lrgr_than_0 = sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "low", "medium", "high", "high"))
)
```
